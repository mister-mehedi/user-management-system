## üóÑÔ∏è Database Setup

You need to create a PostgreSQL database for the application to connect to.

1. Open your PostgreSQL client (like `psql` or a GUI tool like pgAdmin).
2. Create a new database named `intern_db`:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE intern_db;
   ```

3. Create a dedicated user and grant privileges:

   ```sql
   CREATE USER myuser WITH PASSWORD 'mypassword';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE intern_db TO myuser;
   ```

---

## üîß Application Configuration

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd user-management-system
   ```

2. Navigate to the `src/main/resources` directory and open the `application.properties` file.

3. Update the database connection properties:

   ```properties
   # PostgreSQL Database connection settings
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/intern_db
   spring.datasource.username=myuser
   spring.datasource.password=mypassword
   spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver
   ```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

Once the prerequisites and configuration are complete, you can run the application using Maven:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt in the root directory of the project.
2. Execute the following Maven command:

   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

The application will start on the embedded Tomcat server, typically on port `8080`. You should see log output indicating a successful connection to the `intern_db` database.
